The single hardware components of the device are:
 - Adafruit small plastic project enclosure, waterproof
 - PCB (created by Eagle layout)
 - Adadruit feather adalogger M0
 - Adafruit feather OLED display 128x32
 - 3x reference resistor 4k 0.1% accuracy (Vishay PTF654K0000BZEK)
 - 3x reference resistor 0k4 0.1% accuracy (Vishay PTF65400R00AZBF)
 - 3x MAX31865 temperature reader SSOP package, Maxim Integrated 
 - 3x Adafruit PCB breakout TSSOP
 - 9x 100nF and 3x 10nF capacitors
 - micro SD card
 - LiPoly battery
 - optional: USB adapter
 - breadboard sized headers, pins, switches, jumpers and screw terminals
